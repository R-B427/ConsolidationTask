Hello, 

I have made all necessary changes that I could have made and even consulted on respected forums. 
all html files show with the relative content on my end. 
I physically cannot make anymore changes because there are no changes to be made, I have been going around in circles

All reviews have only told me whats wrong instead of assisting me in fixing the situation at hand
I do not have time to do a face to face call

If there are any serious issues I will address them, but as I have stated, everything works and shows on my end
If it does not work on your end, please tell me exactly how to fix it because I am becoming tired of redoing the same thing over and over.

Thansk so much
